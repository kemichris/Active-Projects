## About Dapp

The centralize system of voting has been proving to be ineffective and less transparent, so i built this voting dapp to enable users have a transparent system of voting.

### What dapp can do

. Users are able to submit there address for approval


. Approved address can then proceed to vote.


. users can vote for any proposal of there choice.


. users will be able to check vote result immediately and see the winner
